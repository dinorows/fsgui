fsgui is an AngularJS combat flight scheduler. This demo showcases 10 things critical to a desktop & mobile cross-platform solution: 

1. AngularJS, jQuery and jQuery-mobile, Bootstrap, Mobiscroll, Wijmo, and Webix 
2. Single pane of glass (modal dialogs for data entry, not another web page!) 
3. Security banners and notification panels (Hanscom AFB time panel) 
4. Mobile data input controls (add new sortie capability) 
5. Calendar scheduling (sorties view) 
6. Tiles (drag and drop on HTML canvas) in support of fast Command and Control functionality (mission view) 
7. Customizable UI skins (Theme, on horizontal ribbon) 
8. Adaptive menus (from vertical accordion to horizontal depending on browser form factor) 
9. Ajax JSON-based info exchange for view grid population (pilots and tails) 
10.Universal filtering (Filter textbox on pilots and tails lists) 

AngularJS makes it simple to implement large enterprise apps, to wire up enterprise-branded HTML fragments for reuse, to patch in enterprise-branded javascript fragments via the Model-View-Binder (MVB) pattern, and to mix and match other javascript libraries that provide built-in capabilities, often for free or for a small source-code-included license fee. The resulting code is easy to understand and evolve..
